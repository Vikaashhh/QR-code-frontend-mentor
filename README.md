# QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Challenge

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H) from Frontend Mentor. I successfully built a responsive QR code card using only HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

This project was a great opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS skills by building a simple yet visually appealing QR code component. 

### The Challenge

The goal was to build a QR code component card that:
- Looks as close as possible to the provided design
- Is responsive across different screen sizes
- Uses proper HTML structure and CSS styling

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for responsive layout
- Mobile-first workflow

## My Process

I approached this project using these steps:

1. First, I structured the content with semantic HTML to ensure a solid foundation
2. Then I implemented basic CSS styling for typography and colors
3. I used CSS Flexbox to center the card and create a responsive layout that works on all device sizes
4. Finally, I fine-tuned the spacing, shadows, and other visual details to match the design

### What I Learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of CSS Flexbox for creating responsive layouts. I particularly focused on using Flexbox to center elements both horizontally and vertically, which is a common pattern in web design.

## Deployment

I deployed my solution on Netlify, which offers a simple and free hosting option for static websites.
